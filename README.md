# Key Findings
Cost Drivers - Smoking and Obesity: Individuals classified as both obese and smokers drive significant healthcare costs. Our analysis indicates that smoking emerges as a more significant contributing factor compared to obesity. This conclusion is supported by the t-test results, revealing a notably higher level of evidence for smokers, characterized by a t-value of 32.8, in contrast to obesity, where the t-value is 2.11.

Distinct Characteristics of Subgroup: The subgroup of obese smokers plays a pivotal role in overall cost dynamics, necessitating focused interventions for effective cost management.

Predictive Analysis Conclusion: Random Forest Regressor emerges as the top-performing model in this analysis, showcasing the best balance between model complexity, training data fit, and generalization to unseen data.

SVC Model Outperforms KNN: The Support Vector Classification (SVC) model outperformed the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, showing promising results with slightly higher accuracy of 93.65% and F1 score of 85.47.

Implications for Intervention and Optimization: These findings inform targeted intervention strategies and cost optimization, providing valuable insights for refining healthcare cost management approaches.​![image](https://github.com/Rubalkhehra/Medical_cost_analysis/assets/54534273/d37227b2-20aa-47ad-aeb4-fe9c3646b5ee)
