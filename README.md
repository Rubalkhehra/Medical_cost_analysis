# Medical_cost_analysis
Conduct a comprehensive analysis of medical cost drivers to inform strategic insurance decision-making and predictive modeling. 
This analysis seeks to identify the primary and contributing factors responsible for the current healthcare cost trajectory, thereby enabling more informed and optimized decision-making.
We have developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application alongside a chatbot as integral components of the project.

The primary beneficiaries of this analysis will be insurance companies, healthcare providers, policymakers, regulators and patients who will be able to determine various factors to keep their medical cost down.

# Key Findings
Cost Drivers - Smoking and Obesity: Individuals classified as both obese and smokers drive significant healthcare costs. Our analysis indicates that smoking emerges as a more significant contributing factor compared to obesity. This conclusion is supported by the t-test results, revealing a notably higher level of evidence for smokers, characterized by a t-value of 32.8, in contrast to obesity, where the t-value is 2.11.

Distinct Characteristics of Subgroup: The subgroup of obese smokers plays a pivotal role in overall cost dynamics, necessitating focused interventions for effective cost management.

Predictive Analysis Conclusion: Random Forest Regressor emerges as the top-performing model in this analysis, showcasing the best balance between model complexity, training data fit, and generalization to unseen data.

SVC Model Outperforms KNN: The Support Vector Classification (SVC) model outperformed the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, showing promising results with slightly higher accuracy of 93.65% and F1 score of 85.47.

Implications for Intervention and Optimization: These findings inform targeted intervention strategies and cost optimization, providing valuable insights for refining healthcare cost management approaches.​![image](https://github.com/Rubalkhehra/Medical_cost_analysis/assets/54534273/d37227b2-20aa-47ad-aeb4-fe9c3646b5ee)
